#Ultrasonic flowmeter diagnostics Data Set 
	Meter D contains 180 instances of diagnostic parameters for a 4-path liquid USM. It has 44 attributes and 4 classes: 
	Class '1' - Healthy 
	Class '2' - Gas injection 
	Class '3' - Installation effects 
	Class '4' - Waxing
#User Knowledge Modeling Data Set 
	STG (The degree of study time for goal object materails), (input value) 
	SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails) (input value) 
	STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
	LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object) (input value) 
	PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects) (input value) 
	UNS (The knowledge level of user) (target value) 
	Very Low: 50 
	Low:129 
	Middle: 122 
	High 130
#Vertebral Column Data Set 
	Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): 
	pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. 
	The following convention is used for the class labels: 
	DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).
